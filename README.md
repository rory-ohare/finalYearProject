# finalYearProject

The microservice based architecture has been widely adopted as the standard way of developing large software systems, separating out functionality into many independent services. This has not been universally adopted by banking institutions, despite the growing need to modernise their systems for the increasingly digital landscape. Much of their software is still built using a monolithic approach, with all the functionality tightly integrated into a single solution. The aim of this project is to investigate the performance of microservices, as well as the cloud computing technologies that have risen around them, namely containerization and container orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes. The project discusses how a microservices based banking system can be built, and tests how robust and scalable it is.
